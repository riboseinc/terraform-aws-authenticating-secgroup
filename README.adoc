= Terraform Module For Dynamically Managing Security Group IPs

This module is available on the https://registry.terraform.io/modules/riboseinc/authenticating-secgroup/aws/[Terraform Registry].


== Components

- API Gateway that performs authorization.
- On-demand Lambda function (linked to API Gateway method `POST|DELETE /connection`): to add/remove rules on-demand
- Continuous Lambda function: to clean up expired rules


== On-demand Lambda Function: Adding/Removing Rules

This is the Lambda function that runs `authorize-security-group-ingress` and
`revoke-security-group-ingress` on-demand on the given security group.

Steps:

1. Authenticate the user via AWS IAM (Signature Version 4).
.. Eligibility to authenticate is set in a policy outside of this module.
.. The user will provide an AWS v4 signature for authentication.
.. Return 403 if not authorized.

2. Once authenticated,
.. Find out the source IP address (a host "/32").

.. If the request is a `POST /connection`
... The function will add a `authorize-security-group-ingress` rule for this
  source IP address, with a description that indicates the "time" that this rule
  was added. Return 201.

... If the source IP address is already in the security-group, update the description using `update-security-group-rule-descriptions-ingress` to reflect the latest time.
... Return 200.

.. If the request is a `DELETE /connection`
... If the source IP address is in the security-group, issue a `revoke-security-group-ingress` on it. Return 200.
... If the source IP address is not in the security group, do nothing. Return 404.

3. Done.

== Continuous Lambda Function: Removing Rules

This is the Lambda function that runs `revoke-security-group-ingress` on the
given security group on rule expiry.

This AWS Lambda function runs every X seconds, and its sole task is to clean
out the security group that has stale rules.

Steps:

1. The function will describe all rules in the given security group.

2. For every rule, it will check the description for the time of last update.
.. If the elapsed time is less than the configured X seconds, don't do anything.
.. If the elapsed time is more than the configured X seconds, it means that the
  rule has expired, and it should execute `revoke-security-group-ingress` on it.
  (e.g., if all rules are expired, the security group should now contain no rules)

3. Done.


== Sample Usage

[source,go]
----
variable "aws-account-id" {
  default = "my-aws-account-id"
}

module "dynamic-secgroup" {
  source = "riboseinc/authenticating-secgroup/aws"
  aws-account-id = "${var.aws-account-id}"

  # Description of this secgroup
  description = "Developer SSH Access"

  # Where to add the rules to
  security-groups = [
    "${aws_security_group.instance_group_1_ssh.id}",
    "${aws_security_group.instance_group_2_ssh.id}"
  ]

  # Parameters for creating security group rules
  # secgroup-rule-type      = "ingress" we dont need type
  secgroup-rule-from_port = 22
  secgroup-rule-to_port   = 22
  secgroup-rule-protocol  = "-1"

  # Time to expiry for every rule.
  # Default: 600 seconds.
  time_to_expire = "600"
}

# A group we want to provide SSH access to
resource "aws_iam_group" "developers" {
  name = "developers"
}

# Who can access this API (i.e., who can be added to the dynamic secgroup)
resource "aws_iam_group_policy_attachment" "developers-access-ssh" {
  group      = "${aws_iam_group.developers.name}"
  policy_arn = "${module.dynamic-secgroup.api-gateway-access-policy-arn}"
}


# Some outputs

output "dynamic-secgroup-api-gateway-arn" {
  value = "${module.dynamic-secgroup.api-gateway-arn}"
}

output "dynamic-secgroup-api-gateway-access-policy-arn" {
  value = "${module.dynamic-secgroup.api-gateway-access-policy-arn}"
}
----


The `module.dynamic-secgroup.api-gateway-access-policy-arn` is something like:

[source,go]
----
resource "aws_iam_policy" "secgroup-access-policy" {
  name        = "secgroup-access-policy"
  description = "Policy: ${var.description}"
  policy      = "${data.aws_iam_policy_document.secgroup-access-policy-doc.json"
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "secgroup-access-policy-doc" {
  policy_id = "ssh-access-policy"

  statement {
    sid = "AccessSecurityGroup"
    effect = "Allow"
    actions = [
      "execute-api:Invoke"
    ]
    resource: [
      "arn:aws:execute-api:${var.aws-region}:${var.aws-account-id}:${aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api.name}/*/DELETE/connection",
      "arn:aws:execute-api:${var.aws-region}:${var.aws-account-id}:${aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api.name}/*/POST/connection"
    ]
  }
}

output "api-gateway-access-policy-arn" {
  value = "aws_iam_policy.secgroup-access-policy.arn"
}
